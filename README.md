# Chapa-MEF

This project is an application for the simulation of two-dimensional solids using the Finite Element Method (FEM).

It was designed and implemented in Fortran aiming high performance, thus it uses sparse matrix to solve the linear system and can run in parallel with OpenMP.


*This code was my first and only code developed in Fortran.*
